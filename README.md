## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.7. It utilizes the following packages:

**[Pandas Library Python](https://pandas.pydata.org/)** - a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool.<br>

**[pathlib Library Python](https://pathlib.readthedocs.io/en/pep428/)** - offers a set of classes featuring all the common operations on paths in an easy, object-oriented way.<br>

**[tensorflow Python](https://https://www.tensorflow.org/)** - an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.<br>

**[scikit-learn Python](https://scikit-learn.org/)** - simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis.<br>

## Installation Guide

Before running the application install the following dependencies:

1) Pandas Library is included with Anaconda so no need to install.<br>

2) pathlib is included with Anaconda so no need to install.<br>

3) In order to use the tensorflow library, you must install it by writing this command in your terminal:

```python
pip install--upgrade tensorflow
```

4) Scikit_learn Library is included with Anaconda so no need to install.<br>

The installation of libraries and dependencies is now complete.

## Usage

To use the application simply clone the repository and run the **venture_funding_with_deep_learning.ipynb** file with:

```python
venture_funding_with_deep_learning.ipynb
```

For best results, it is recommended to open as a Jupyter Notebook.
